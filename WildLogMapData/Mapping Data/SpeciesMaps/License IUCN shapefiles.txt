1. General 

This User Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions of a license for you to use The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species™ website (hereafter referred to as "The Red List") and the data within it ("IUCN Red List Data"). For the purposes of this Agreement, IUCN Red List Data comprise all tabular, and all spatial and associated attribute, data, contained within The IUCN Red List. By accessing and/or using The IUCN Red List, you have read, consent and agree to comply with all of the Terms and Conditions of this User Agreement. The rights and obligations concerning use of The IUCN Red List in accordance with this User Agreement are personal to you or to members of your household and are not transferable to any other person or entity. From time to time, these Terms and Conditions of Use of The IUCN Red List may be modified. Accordingly, please continue to review the Terms and Conditions whenever accessing or using The IUCN Red List, since any use by you after any such changes, modifications, or additions shall be governed by this User Agreement.
 
2. Copyrights and ownership 

The IUCN Red List contains copyrighted material and/or other proprietary information and thus, IUCN Red List Data are protected by intellectual property agreements and copyright laws and regulations worldwide. IUCN and/or their collaborators are the sole and exclusive owners of all rights, titles and interests, including trademarks, copyrights, trade names, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights, contained in the data and software of The IUCN Red List.
 
You agree to not alter or remove any copyright symbol or other identification concerning authorship of any of the materials contained on or otherwise made available to you in The IUCN Red List.
 
3. No commercial use 

Neither (a) IUCN Red List Data nor (b) any work derived from or based upon IUCN Red List Data (i.e., “Derivative Works”) may be put to Commercial Use without the prior written permission of IUCN. For the purposes of these Terms and Conditions, “Commercial Use” means a) any use by, on behalf of, or to inform or assist the activities of, a commercial entity (an entity that operates ‘for profit’) or b) use by any individual or non-profit entity for the purposes of revenue generation. If you wish to use the information obtained from The IUCN Red List for such commercial purposes, please contact IUCN directly using the contact details below in section 16.
 
4. No reposting, sublicensing and/or redistribution 

All forms of reposting, sub-licensing, reselling, or other forms of redistribution of the IUCN Red List Data in their original format, either whole or in part, alone or combined with other data, are strictly prohibited without the prior written permission of IUCN. You may not repost, or redistribute to any third party, the IUCN Red List Data contained in The IUCN Red List in whole, or in part, by any means, including (but not limited to) electronic formats such as internet postings, web downloads, through web services, through interactive web maps that grant users download access, KML files or through file transfer protocols, electronic mailing, faxing, archiving in a public data, redistributing via a computer network, CD, memory stick or other electronic media, except as may otherwise be expressly permitted by IUCN in writing.  
 
If you wish to provide a service through which IUCN Red List Data are otherwise made available for reposting or otherwise made available for redistribution, please contact IUCN directly using the contact details below in section 16. 
 
You agree to direct all requests from third parties for access to the data you obtained from The IUCN Red List to the IUCN Red List Unit at the address stated in section 16. 
 
5. Derivative works 

Derivative works based on IUCN Red List Data may be distributed, including electronically or in print form, without prior written permission by IUCN, provided that Derivative works are made available with a non-commercial restriction use and that appropriate acknowledgement and citation to source is included. For the purposes of these Terms and Conditions, a “Derivative work” is a new work that is based upon all, or part, of the IUCN Red List Data. To be considered a Derivative work, the new work must be transformative and include originality on the part of the creator’s, otherwise it may simply be considered reposting or redistribution, depending on the way the new work is made available. 
 
Use of these data does not constitute endorsement by IUCN or its partners of any derived products, reports or analyses. The IUCN and IUCN Red List of Threatened Species logos must not be used on any derived products, reports or analyses, or supporting materials, without express (written) permission. 
 
6. Usage 

Provided that any use is otherwise in accordance with the Terms and Conditions of this User Agreement, you are hereby granted a non-transferable license to use, download and print the materials contained in The IUCN Red List, without requesting prior permission, solely for conservation or education purposes, scientific analyses, and research.
 
7. Acknowledgements and citation 

The recipient of the data will provide full acknowledgement and citation in any materials or publications derived in part or in whole from the data; relevant citation details are provided with each dataset. For any publications making significant use of the data, IUCN and its partners welcome the opportunity for collaboration, and possible co-authorship, and to comment prior to publication. Expressions of interest can be sent directly to IUCN using the contact details below in section 16.
 
8. IUCN Red List updates
 
Unless required to do so for specific analyses, you should not use any version of the IUCN Red List Data after it has been superseded by a subsequent version. It is your responsibility to check if an update of The IUCN Red List is available.

 
9. Feedback and revised information
 
In order to keep the IUCN Red List Data up to date, IUCN, the Species Survival Commission and IUCN Red List Partner organizations would welcome feedback on the quality, reliability and accuracy of the data. Such contributions should be free of restrictions, and IUCN commits to provide appropriate acknowledgement and credit for any such contributions. The objective is to improve the IUCN Red List Data for the benefit of the global conservation community. For information on providing data to IUCN for updating the IUCN Red List Data, please contact IUCN directly using the contact details below in section 16.
